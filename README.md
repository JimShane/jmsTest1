# jmsTest1
I work in a very small company (3 employees).   A coworker developed our website many years ago (early 2000s).   He used Drupal.   He has long ago left our company  
I had to upgrade the Drupal in 2015 (I think to bring it to Drupal 7).  But, it seems all I had to do was run the components in the software without really knowing
what I was doing.  Now, it is no longer supported, so I am attempting to learn Drupal 11 to bring our website back online!
